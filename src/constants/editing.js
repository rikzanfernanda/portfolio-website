    summary:
        'The tools I use are Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I have more than 3 years experience in graphic design. Making a quality design requires several considerations such as the target audience and creative content. In making designs, I like to make designs that are modern, simple, clean, functional, stylish and keep up with the times. Like some of my work at: https://www.behance.net/rikzan_fernanda',
